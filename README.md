My name is Christian. I'm a software developer from South Australia with an interest in natural languages, programming languages (and some programming language theory), and a whole bunch of other miscellaneous things like dinosaurs, fighter jets, and calvin-and-hobbesian combinations thereof.

### Filling out the README template

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: my own portfolio, my day job, completing Elden Ring, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Chinese, Astro, Remix, Vue 3 (coming from prior Vue 2 knowledge), Rust, Zig
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: TBC

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter, probably.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he, they (I also don't mind mistakes from English learners)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know TypeScript types or JSDoc `@typedef`s can share the same name as exported values in JS/TS modules? Use this knowledge responsibly!
